## Education

* 2010-2015
**Informatic Sciences Engineering**; Universidad de las Ciencias Informáticas (Havana, Cuba)
*Thesis title: Proxy communication system for Android*


## Experience

* **Feasibility Study for LEGO recognition machine (2017-2018 [aleph].engineering-MeineSpielzeugkiste):**

Using Computer Vision, Python and Tensorflow, developed a feasibility study to demonstrate that a machine to recognize specific LEGO sets can be built using machine learning.

* **Documents and cases management system Papyrus Case (2015-2017 DATYS):**

During two years I worked with a team of 10-15 highly trained engineers in the development of this software. We used **Grails** framework to build the backend and **Angular** 1 on the frontend. I had the opportunity to use both **Team Foundation Server** and **GIT** as control version system and always used agile techniques to manage our team and projects. The platform was supposed to work with multiple databases in a very generic way, but at the time I left the project, only ORACLE database was implemented since it was the most known among the experts in the group. I also had the chance to work with **Docker** and loved the technology so much that I started teaching my coworkers about it. During this time the project was deployed in multiple Banks in Cuba and other important state institutions to help them manage their documents and workflow and it was actively maintained.

* **NOVA, the Cuban GNU/Linux (2012-2015 Universidad de las ciencias informáticas):**

As a student, I worked in the development of the Cuban GNU/Linux distribution NOVA. During three years I developed multiple functionalities for NOVA, writing mainly in **C**, **C++**, **Python** and **Bash**.

## Technical Experience

* **Open Source**

I love Open Source. I try to open as much of my work as possible as my GitHub [profile](https://github.com/jadolg) shows. I contribute to Projects like [Rocket.Chat](http://rocket.chat) and have my own [Rocket.Chat API wrapper](https://github.com/jadolg/rocketchat_API) written in Python. I also contribute to the Cuban Conference about Free and Open Source Software [CubaConf](http://cubaconf.org/).

* **Programming Languages**
  * **Python:** This is my first class language. I have more than 8 years of experience using Python and I'm improving my skills on it every day. I have used Django and Flask frameworks for years and can code in Python 2 and 3 both. 

  * **Java:** I've used java for Desktop applications development using swing, and to write Android applications. I can write and deploy java applications from scratch and can learn new java skills very fast.

  * **GO:** GO or GOLANG is my newest tool. I am in love with this language and I'm wanting to start working with this professionally.

  * Also know **C**, **C++**, **JavaScript**, **Groovy**, **Kotlin**

* **Other Technologies**
  * **Android:** I have developed several apps for Android using native technologies. I have used both Java and Kotlin.
  * **GNU/Linux:** My development environment is always linux-based. I've being working with GNU/Linux for more than 9 years and prefer Debian based systems like Ubuntu.
  * **Docker:** Docker reduces the gap between the developer environment and the staging and production scenario. I've used Docker to test and deploy software and it's a technology I use almost everyday. I'm also familiar with docker-compose.
  * **git:** I use git everyday. I could not be able to work without it. Version control is very important to me and I believe in [this](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) way to do commits.
  * **RaspberryPi, ESP8266 and other IoT related:** I'm passionate about IoT. I have developed projects with RaspberryPi and ESP8266 using mostly Python and Micropython.
